# Multilingual Document Q&A & Summarizer

A web application built with **Streamlit**, **LangChain**, and **Hugging Face Transformers** that allows users to upload documents (PDF, DOCX, or TXT), ask questions about the content in English, summarize the text, and translate answers and summaries into multiple languages.

---

## Features

- Upload and preview documents in PDF, DOCX, or TXT format.
- Ask natural language questions related to the uploaded document content.
- Get concise, context-aware answers using state-of-the-art NLP models.
- Summarize lengthy documents or sections into short, informative summaries.
- Translate answers and summaries into various languages.
- Interactive and easy-to-use web interface powered by Streamlit.

## Installation and Configuration

1. Clone this repository:
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create an account on "https://huggingface.co/" and generate an access token with READ permissions. Configure that token in your virtual environment:

```
export HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN="YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

## Usage

Run the Streamlit app:
```
streamlit run app.py
```
Open the URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:8501`) in your browser.

## How It Works

- Upload a document in supported formats.
- The app extracts text from the document backend.
- Ask questions in English related to the document's content.
- Receive answers generated by Hugging Face QA models.
- Generate summaries of the document, which can be translated to other languages.
- Uses caching to optimize model load times and user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit:** For building the interactive web UI.
- **LangChain:** For document text processing and chaining NLP components.
- **Hugging Face Transformers:** Pre-trained models for question answering, summarization, and translation.
- **PyPDF2**, **python-docx:** Document parsing libraries.

## Model Recommendations

- Question Answering: `deepset/deberta-v3-large-squad2` or `allenai/longformer-base-4096-squad2` for longer contexts.
- Summarization: `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6` for lightweight summarization.
- Translation: Helsinki NLP models like `Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr`.

---

## Notes and Tips

- Large documents should be chunked to improve accuracy and performance.
- The Hugging Face cache directory can grow large; monitor your disk usage and clear the cache if needed
- Play with models and test which will work best as per the use case to provide more accuracy
